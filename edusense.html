                            The only way for a university professor to get direct & personalised feedback on their
                            teaching, to help them develop
                            professionally, involves observation by an expert who sits in their class, analyses their
                            behaviour and provides
                            feedback on their performance. But, finding such experts might be difficult and not the
                            least, costly.

                        According to the learning sciences, after a teacher asks a question, they should wait at least 3
                        - 5
                        seconds after the first that student raises their hand so as to allow enough time for other
                        students to remember the information and articulate a good answer. Therefore, EduSense sends
                        a timely notification after the first hand goes up, reminding the instructor to wait for 3s.

                        Movement of an instructor is directly associated with the students attentions and engagement in
                        class. Teachers standin/spending time behind the podium are perceived as not welcoming by the
                        students whereas teachers that walk in and around class or come in close proximity to students
                        are perceived as waremer and friendly.
