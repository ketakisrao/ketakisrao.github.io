                                <div>Firstly, I had to design a simple HTML form to
                                        onboard
                                        the users of the
                                        application. This had to be a responsive design that works well for all
                                        types
                                        of devices
                                        (mobiles, laptops, tablets) since the users received an email link to
                                        register
                                        themselves
                                        which could be opened on any device by the client.</div>
                                <div class="signup-img"><img src="images/Registration.png" /></div>

                        <div class="box">
                                <h4>Search page for the users</h4>
                                <div>
                                        My next task was to design a search bar to look up various investors
                                        and startups. Since a user could search for startups in particular or
                                        for investors alone, I had to provide them an option by which they
                                        could filter and limit their search to either of the two.
                                </div>
                                <img src="images/searchbar.png" class="full-img" />
                                <div>
                                        The results obtained were to be displayed on a clean UI
                                </div>
                                <img src="images/SearchResult.png" class="full-img" />
